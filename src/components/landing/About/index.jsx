        <Quarry>
          <h1>Granite Quarry</h1>
          <p>
            Our product consists of granite aggregates crushed to different
            sizes to meet our client's requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            Crush aggregates are mainly used as raw material to produce
            asphaltic concrete (premix), concrete ready-mix, and so on.
          </p>
